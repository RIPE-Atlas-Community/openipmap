OpenIPMap tries to improve Internet Infrastructure geolocation by crowdsourcing

This currently consists of 2 sub projects:
  - django-openipmap : The actual django code for an openipmap instance
  - openipmap-provision : Provisioning of an openipmap instance in a virtual environment using Vagrant, virtualbox and ansible. Please refer to the openipmap-provision documentation on how to actually set this up.
