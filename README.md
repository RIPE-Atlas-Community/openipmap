**This is an outdated prototype. The current version is called RIPE IPmap and is available at https://ipmap.ripe.net/.**

RIPE IPmap ~~OpenIPMap~~ tries to improve Internet Infrastructure geolocation by crowdsourcing

A running instance of ~~OpenIPMap~~ can be found here:
https://marmot.ripe.net/openipmap/
**Note: This running prototype will be shut down in the near future.**



The codebase currently consists of 2 sub projects:
  - django-openipmap : The actual django code for an openipmap instance
  - openipmap-provision : Provisioning of an openipmap instance in a virtual environment using Vagrant, virtualbox and ansible. Please refer to the openipmap-provision documentation on how to actually set this up.
